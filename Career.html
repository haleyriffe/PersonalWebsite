		<td>I started my journey as an educator in my senior year of high school. I decided to co-op at an elementary school in my town. It was there that I decided I loved working with kids. I then decided to apply to Morehead State University and attend with my best friend, Emily. I roomed with her and 2 other random roommates in Nunn Hall. In the spring of my freshman year, I decided to join the Delta Zeta sorority. It was there that I met lifelong friends and eventually became VP of New Member Education. I loved everything about my time at MSU, from the friends I made, to the coursework I completed, and to the professors I got to work with. I did most of my field experience at schools in Rowan County and loved it. The teachers I observed were all fantastic educators who shaped me into the teacher I am today. Student teaching was part of this amazing experience. My cooperating teachers and advisor were wonderful to work with and taught me so much. Although my college education was somewhat interrupted by COVID, I believe it set me up for success when going into my teaching career.</td>
<td>I began my teaching career at Flemingsburg Elementary School in 2021. I was hired as a 2nd grade teacher for the 2021-2022 school year. It was there that I learned the ins and outs of working in a school as well as being a classroom teacher. I learned a lot about classroom management, curriculum, phonics, and being part of a school community. I completed many hours of professional learning including Kagan training and Project Read training. This was where I really learned how to teach students to read. After 1 year at FES, I was hired as a 1st grade teacher at Owingsville Elementary School. It was there that I experienced what it's like to work with small children and manage an extremely diverse classroom. I continued my professional learning by doing LETRS training and practicing my learning with the students in my class. I worked on an amazing team and learned a whole lot more about classroom management. I also began my Masters program to be a school librarian. </td>
<td>I decided I wanted to be a school librarian during my student teaching experience. I loved the idea of working with all the kids in a school as well as sharing my love for reading. I am an organized person so I felt like keeping a library collection is the right job for me. During my time in the classes I have had, I felt like I learned so much more about what it takes to run a library. I have especially enjoyed getting experience in the library as well as creating a library website. You can visit the OES library website here at <b><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oeslibrary/home">OES Library</a></b> As an elementary teacher, I know that I would feel more comfortable becoming an elementary librarian, however, I would love to work in a high school library in the future. I am looking forward to becoming a school librarian soon. </td>
