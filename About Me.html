  My name is Haley Riffe. I was born and raised in Carter County, KY in the town of Grayson. I was raised with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. Growing up with so many siblings as well as plenty of nieces and nephews has made me very family-oriented. <hr> 
  I graduated East Carter High School in 2017 and attended Morehead State University as a freshman in the fall of that year. I spent my 4 years at MSU making memories with my best friends, meeting my future husband Daniel, joining the Delta Zeta sorority, and learning how to be an elementary teacher.<hr> 
  In 2021, I graduated from MSU with my Bachelor's in Elementary Education. Soon after graduation, Daniel and I got engaged and began planning a wedding. Around the same time, I accepted a 2nd grade teaching position at Flemingsburg Elementary School. In that year, Daniel and I got married and celebrated our honeymoon over spring break. After a year there, I accepted a position as a 1st grade teacher at Owingsville Elementary School. During this school year I began my Masters degree to be a school librarian. And all that leads me to here! Learn more about my career experiences and accomplishments in the <b><a href= "Career.html">Career</a></b> section.<hr>

<figcaption>Daniel and I on our wedding day <b>April 2, 2022.</b><br> We met in high school where we were both in the same grade. Throughout high school, we were aquaintances that rarely spoke. After graduation, we both ended up at MSU and even in the same dorm hall, just 1 floor apart. We were still just friends until 2019 when I reached out to him on social media. We began talking and the rest is history.

<figcaption>This is our sweet, energetic, and loyal chocolate lab, Sailor. Daniel got her as a puppy right before we started dating. She quickly warmed up to me and I got to experience the highs and lows of raising a puppy. We take her on trips to the beach, the lake, hiking trails, and even just on car-rides to the store. She loves to swim, chase squirrels, hunt, fish, and chew up anything she can find. We wouldn't trade her for the world!
